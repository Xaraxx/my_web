Today, after many days without write any line of code I decide to practice. In the live of any programmer (or any people, actually) you pass for many emotional states, I had been passing a period of a kind of infatuation with the programming, in summary, I spent many hours every day studing many kinds of different technical topics as Javascrit, Python, Flask I watch many technical videos, I read a dozen of related articles in English and Spanish and at the end of all that crazzy time, I made some test's and I didn't pass some of then, as result of that I think: *"Ok this isn't to me! I hate programming!"* But I really love to program so I don't give up so easy! so, I say to my self: *"Ey bo! you have to practice, that way you are going to improve your programming skills"*. And here I am.

At begining to my practice journey, I went to the Django project web page to give a look to the lastest changes to the Django Framework in the documentation and then, I found out something incredible, as you can see in the picture, the Django foundation joined to massive rejection to the lastest dies occurring in the afro-american comunity in the United States of America.   

That was a huge surprise to me because, in many organizations and Tech comunities, this kind of topics are like: *'is this not our business'*. But, in this case, the Django Software Foundation have been clear: Is this a business of all of us. And in my opinion, is this a big lesson for all of us... You can't see the injusticeness and just turn your eyes to another place. 

Many people ignore that the industrial society and first world countries have been rise over the exploitation of business as slavery and it is not just a topic living in the past, the economical revenues of slave trade are present in our days. 

According to the article, ["Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds among UK banks that had links to slavery"](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/18/barclays-hsbc-and-lloyds-among-uk-banks-that-had-links-to-slavery) published in the british daily, The Guardian; *between the 10% and 20% of Britain's wealthy can be indentified as having significant links to slavery*[^1]. Furthermore, *the amount of money borrowed to pay off slave owners was so large that the government only repaid it fully in 2015*[^2];  according to the publish the payment was, in response to the *Slave Compensation Act* that provided £20m in payments to 46.000 slaveowners without giving any compensation to the former slaves. In other words, the British state has been to spending public resources to pay the slaveowners compensation until our days. So slavery isn't past issue.

Beyond the economic implications of the slave trade, we have witnessed  the many cases of police brutality against Afro-American people; this situation remembers me a song performed by Billie Holiday titled [*Strange Fruit*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Web007rzSOI), in other words, police brutality is another way to lynch Afro-American people, and I ask myself ¿How many years we going to keep 'planting' this Strange Fruits?

This have to stop.
